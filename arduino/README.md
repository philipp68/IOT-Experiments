## Components
### Real Time Clock
If you need to keep track of time, a real time clock is the way to go. Even if you power down your computer, the real time clock will continue to work, because it comes with it's own backup battery. So when you're computer comes back online, it can retreive the current time from the RTC clock, without having to go out to the Internet.
